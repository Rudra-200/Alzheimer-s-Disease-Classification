          <p>
            We collected this dataset from
            <a href="https://adni.loni.usc.edu/data-samples/adni-data-inventory/" target=blank><em>ADNI (Alzheimer’s
                Disease Neuroimaging Initiative). </em></a>
            <br><br> Alzheimer’s Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) is a longitudinal multicenter study designed to
            develop clinical, imaging, genetic, and biochemical biomarkers for the early detection and tracking of
            Alzheimer’s disease (AD).
          </p>
          <p>
            The dataset consists of 5 stages of Alzheimer's Disease already split into two directories for training and
            testing.
          </p>
          <br>
          <p>
            <strong>1. EMCI (Early Mild Cognitive Impairment):</strong>
            - EMCI represents the early stage of mild cognitive impairment (MCI), which is often a precursor to
            Alzheimer's Disease.
            - Individuals with EMCI may experience subtle changes in cognitive function, such as memory lapses or
            difficulties with problem-solving, that are noticeable but not severe enough to interfere significantly with
            daily life activities.
            - Early detection and intervention during this stage may help slow down or potentially prevent further
            cognitive decline.
          </p>
          <br>
          <p><strong>2. LMCI (Late Mild Cognitive Impairment):</strong>
            - LMCI denotes the later stage of mild cognitive impairment, where cognitive decline becomes more pronounced
            compared to EMCI.
            - Individuals with LMCI may exhibit more noticeable cognitive deficits, including problems with memory,
            language, attention, and visuospatial abilities.
            - LMCI often serves as an intermediate stage between EMCI and the onset of Alzheimer's Disease, although not
            all individuals with LMCI progress to AD.

          </p>
          <br>
          <p><strong> 3. MCI (Mild Cognitive Impairment):</strong>
            - MCI represents a clinical condition characterized by mild but measurable cognitive decline beyond what is
            expected for an individual's age and education level, yet it does not significantly impair daily
            functioning.
            - While some cases of MCI may remain stable or even improve over time, others may progress to Alzheimer's
            Disease or other forms of dementia.
            - Early diagnosis and intervention in MCI are crucial for managing symptoms and potentially delaying the
            onset of more severe cognitive impairment.
          </p>
          <br>
          <p><strong>4. AD (Alzheimer's Disease):</strong>
            - AD is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder characterized by a decline in cognitive function and the
            development of behavioral and functional impairments.
            - Common symptoms of AD include memory loss, confusion, difficulty with language and communication,
            challenges with reasoning and problem-solving, and changes in mood and behavior.
            - The underlying pathology of AD involves the accumulation of abnormal proteins in the brain, leading to
            neuronal damage and loss, particularly in regions associated with memory and cognitive function.
          </p>
          <br>
          <p>
            <strong>5. CN (Cognitively Normal):</strong>
            - CN refers to individuals who do not exhibit significant cognitive impairment and perform within the normal
            range for their age and education level on standardized cognitive assessments.
            - While CN individuals do not show signs of cognitive decline associated with Alzheimer's Disease or other
            dementias, some may still experience subtle changes in cognition as part of the normal aging process.
            - CN individuals often serve as a comparison group in research studies aimed at understanding the
            progression of cognitive decline and identifying early markers of neurodegenerative diseases
            like Alzheimer's.
